# General Assembly SF Presentation (November 30, 2015)


### Slides

The slides from my presentation can be found [here](https://ga-intro-slides.firebaseapp.com).

The source files are in the [`slides`](./slides) directory. See the [README](./slides/README.md) in
that directory for instructions on how to build it.


### Demo

The chat app I built live during my presentation can be found [here](https://ga-intro-to-firebase.firebaseapp.com/).


### Code

You can find the sample code from my live-coded Firebase chat client in the [`chat`](./chat)
directory. I even threw in some [sample security rules](./chat/rules.json) which I didn't get to in
the actual talk.
