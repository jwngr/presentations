# Intro to Firebase - a sample GDG talk

This slide deck can be customized to give an introductory talk about Firebase. It was designed with
[Google Developer Groups](https://developers.google.com/groups/) (GDGs) in mind. Please feel free to
use this talk and customize it for your own needs.

This deck is derived from [a repo created by David East](https://github.com/davideast/firebase-intro),
a Developer Advocate at Firebase. It is powered by [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js), a
wonderful and powerful framework for creating HTML presentations.
